# REST Web application for generating 3D models using Augmented Reality

The project can be used as a tool for improving the education system by using Augmented Reality in order to superimpose digital content for a better representation of the lesson.

It has two types of users: student and teacher. The student can see the lessons that coresponds to each class and also the quiz for each subject. On the other hand, the teacher can do the same as the student and also he/she has an extra page called Attendance which keeps track of each student's activity regarding the lessons and quizes. 

The technologies used for this project are: React, HTML, CSS, Javascript(Frontend), Cloud Firestore and Google Sheets(Backend).

The Demo for the application can be found on the 18th slide of the following canva presentation: https://www.canva.com/design/DAEkAWTHiNM/qLWnqxLX_UzQSxbRFjr3NQ/view?utm_content=DAEkAWTHiNM&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton.
